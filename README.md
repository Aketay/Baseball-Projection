# Baseball-Projection
Baseball data web scraping, simulation, and projection tools

I designed these tools to not only scrape baseball related data from a number of sites (espn.com, fangraphs, etc), but I also try to use them to project daily outcomes of games based upon various statistical methods.

All of these scripts are intended for EDUCATIONAL USE only.
